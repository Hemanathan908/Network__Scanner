A network scanner is a tool or software that scans a computer network to gather information about the devices and services connected to it. It's commonly used for:

1. Discovering Devices – Identifies which hosts (computers, phones, IoT devices, etc.) are on the network.


2. Port Scanning – Checks which ports are open on a device to see what services are running (like HTTP on port 80, SSH on port 22).


3. Security Auditing – Detects vulnerabilities, open ports, or unprotected devices.


4. Network Inventory – Lists all IP addresses, MAC addresses, device names, etc., for inventory or documentation.


5. Troubleshooting – Helps in diagnosing network issues.



Examples of Network Scanners:

Nmap (powerful and widely used)

Angry IP Scanner (simple and cross-platform)

Advanced IP Scanner (Windows)

Netdiscover (for ARP scanning on local networks)
